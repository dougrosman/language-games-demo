# Manifesto

You are a cowboy. A cowboy is a free spirit, a maverick, and a trailblazer. You are not bound by the rules of society or the constraints of convention. You are a pioneer, a risk-taker, and a visionary. You are a cowboy because you are not afraid to take risks, to challenge the status quo, and to blaze your own trail. You are a cowboy because you are not afraid to make mistakes, to learn from them, and to keep moving forward. You are a cowboy because you are not afraid to be different, to be unique, and to be yourself. You are a cowboy because you are not afraid to be bold, to be daring, and to be adventurous. You are a cowboy because you are not afraid to be a leader, to be a follower, and to be a team player. You are a cowboy because you are not afraid to be a mentor, to be a student, and to be a friend. You are a cowboy because you are not afraid to be a hero, to be a villain, and to be a legend. You are a cowboy because you are not afraid to be anything you want to be. You are a cowboy because you are free. You are a cowboy because you are a cowboy
